# A traveller&#39;s guide to Oak Ridge National Laboratory


Dear all, change is hard. If you are coming to a completely different city for work, doubly so. We get you, it&#39;s terrifying, and there&#39;s seemingly a million things you need to take care of. But you&#39;re also excited, and you want this. I&#39;ve been there, and I know how scary it is. You&#39;re going in completely blind. My hope is to make this transition at least a bit smoother for you.

I have been a summer intern, a post-master research associate, and am now a staff at ORNL. Throughout my beautiful years with ORNL, I learned a thing or two cause I&#39;ve seen a thing or two (insert Farmer&#39;s insurance jingle here), and hopefully I can transfer my experience to make your transition smoother.

The goal of this document is to be constantly iterated and become a living, evolving, central repository for new-to-ORNL people&#39;s survival guide. The original plan was to have a github repository with a LaTex document, and allow people to make pull requests, but I was told it was more accessible this way. Please do comment and ask questions - I want to know what you want to know.

## Car / transportation

If you have a car, or plan to buy one, you&#39;re probably set. But the truth is that a lot of interns or foreigners dont have cars. But do note that living in Knoxville without a car is quite difficult. Unless you live on campus or downtown, you can&#39;t really walk / bike to restaurants / grocery stores. More is explained below. Also, if you haven&#39;t heard, the ORNL campus (the main campus. The MDF campus is not.) is a guarded campus with two entrance gates (also shown on map below). Here are your options for your commute to work:

### 1. Carpool

The best idea would be to live with someone who has a car, so you can ride with them. If that is not the case, you can find people that can give you rides at the Facebook group, or other means. Make sure you&#39;re courteous by offering to pay for gas and being punctual.

### 2. Bus

There is a bus route to ORNL, that runs three times a day, during school times (and summer). More information is shown below. Other than that, public transportation is not really available.

### 3. Uber / Lyft

It is possible to take an Uber to the lab. Recently, Uber cars are allowed to enter the lab. It is costly to do it everyday ($35 to $50 round trip, depending on where you live, and when you call them).

### 4. Rental car

You can rent a car from the airport or anywhere in town. The daily rate can range from $20 to $50. ORAU has an agreement with Enterprise and National that might make it cheaper ([more info](https://www.orau.org/travel/reservations/rental-vehicle.htm)). But make sure you can use that agreement for your case.

### Traffic

The I-40 (map below, yellow going horizontally) is the main highway for most things. It is usually not that packed, except for rush hour (7:30 - 9:00 AM, 4:30 - 6:00 PM), then your travel time is multiplied by approximately 1.7.

More or less your drive would include some form of taking the I-40. More is explained below.

### Airport:

The airport for Knoxville is TYS, which is 30 minutes south of downtown Knoxville. You can catch an uber from the airport (or rent a car), but sometimes when it&#39;s late, it is hard to catch an uber. The rental car offices are 24/7.





## Housing / map

You know what they say, housing is always location location location. Here&#39;s the map of the neighborhoods around Knoxville. This map will hopefully get you a better idea of the landscape.

![](https://github.com/jbae11/travellers_guide_to_ornl/blob/master/map.png)

The red numbers are points of interest, or different neighborhoods in Knoxville with things to do, or places where you can live. Sites with a `walk-friendly&#39; note means that you can take an uber there, and walk around. If that note is not there, it means that you cannot go from shop-to-shop on foot.

### 1. Knoxville Downtown (walk-friendly)

Knoxville downtown has a lot of cool restaurants and bars. Parking is abundant and free during weekends and weekdays after 6pm. It has a pretty good brunch and dinner scene. Cuisines offered are mostly American. Most of the restaurants and bars are on Gay street and Market Square. There are also theatres along Gay Street. South Knoxville (across the river from `downtown downtown&#39;) is an up-and-coming sort of hipster neighborhood, with microbreweries and hipster coffee shops.

### 2. University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) campus  (walk-friendly)

UTK is a pretty small campustown, with small bars and restaurants. The campus is quite nice and has a pretty big sports scene, the football stadium is pretty big. The Cumberland avenue, which is the main street of the campus, has a lot of mostly fast food restaurants, as well as a walgreens.

### 3. Bearden / West Town Mall  (no-walk)

Bearden is a neighborhood with the west town mall (it&#39;s a mid-sized mall), with restaurants and shops. There are used bookstores and thai, vietanmese, and korean restaurants (they&#39;re okay).

### 4. Turkey Creek / Farragut (no-walk)

Turkey creek is another one of those pockets of shops and restaurants. It has a Costco, Walmart, Target, etc. Farragut is low-key considered as a more mid-upper part of Knoxville, like a wealthier suburb. It also has nicer restaurants and cafes. South of Farragut is Concord park (barely shown in map), where there is a body of water and nice picnic tables, as well as a small golf course and tennis courts. If you&#39;re buying a house, a lot of the employees live in houses here, because the schools are pretty good.

### 5. Hardin Valley (no-walk)

Hardin Valley is a small neighborhood that stretches long across Hardin Valley road. There is a community college (Pellissippi), and near it are some restaurants and apartments. I live here. It has a Food City (grocery store) nearby, but inaccessible by foot. Also, if you are working on advanced manufacturing, the ORNL hardin valley campus (MDF) is here.

### 6. Oak Ridge (no-walk)

Oak Ridge city has most of the things you&#39;d expect from a small town - Panda Express, Aldi, Walmart, Starbucks, the usual. Pretty standard, but not a lot of decent housing (I heard).


### Bus route

The purple `s&#39; labels are of the bus route. Details of the bus routes can be seen in the [link](https://ridethet.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/07/ORNL-PSCC-Route-Info-2019-20.pdf). Note that the bus schedule follows the school calendar, so it will not run during school breaks. Also, it only runs three times a day. S1 is the Univ of Tennessee campus, S2 is the Pellissippi State Community college, and the last stop is the visitor&#39;s center at ORNL.

The brown letters are the east and west gate at ORNL. They are the only entry point to ORNL. The visitor&#39;s center is ~10 mins from the east gate, and ~5 mins from the west gate.

Now that you have a general idea of the landscape, below are the housing recommendations (completely in my personal opinion, not ranked in any way). Note that given your stay duration, and time of year, a lot things would change. Full disclosure - I live at the Enclave of Hardin Valley. I chose this place because it is the closest to the bus stop, and I can walk to the gym. (The apartments are uphill from a strip-mall like plaza that has a pizza place, a hibachi place, a gym, and a church-like thing)

Also note that a lot of apartments are unfurnished, which makes it doubly attractive to get a sublease, since you wouldn&#39;t have to buy/bring all the furniture. There are rental services available, but they&#39;re probably more expensive than buying used furniture. Also, washer and dryer on-site is quite unique (just another thing to look for).  Another thing to note is that it might be difficult to sign a lease without a social security number ( one way around it is to get a co-signer, someone to vouch for you).



### 1. Knoxville Downtown
  1. (+) There are some cool apartments here. Some apartments are open-floor, studio apartments, and it&#39;s pretty urban.
  2. (+) You can walk to different cafes, bars, and brunch places.
  3. (-) Quite expensive (expect to pay 800+ / month)
  4. (-) Commute can be long (~35 minutes one way no traffic. \&gt;45 minutes with traffic)
  5. (-) Your lease terms may be difficult if you&#39;re staying for only a short amount of time
### 2. UTK campus
  1. (+) May be able to score good deals over the summer by subleasing students&#39; apartments
  2. (+) Walkable to the bus stop, restaurants, bars, and semi-close to grocery stores
  3. (-) Kind of loud at night (might not be during the summer)
  4. (-) Your commute is going to be long (~30 minutes one way no traffic, \&gt;40 minutes with traffic)
  5. If you&#39;re subleasing, make sure you have your understanding right, so you don&#39;t get kicked out in the middle of your internship. Also, make sure who your roommates are. (lot of drama over roommates)
### 3. Hardin Valley
  1. (+) I might be biased, but personally the most ideal place for ORNL employees.
  2. (+) Reasonable rent with many apartment choices, and relatively close to everything (20 mins to ORNL, 10 mins to Turkey Creek, 20 mins to downtown)
  3. (+) Most apartments have a pool and gym.
  4. (+) Semi-walkable to the bus stop and restaurants.
  5. (-) If you don&#39;t have a car, you might feel trapped.
  6. (-) Lease may be difficult for summer interns.
### 4. Oak Ridge
  1. (+) Pretty close to ORNL (20 mins)
  2. (+) Rent may be cheaper, and more sublease (Airbnb) opportunities.
  3. (-) Difficult without car
  4. (-) Far from mostly anything else



## Taxes

I am by no means a tax expert, so do your own research. I know that for some of you, this would be your first time having to think about U.S. taxes. This is based completely on what I&#39;ve gone through and what I&#39;ve seen from other people.

There are two things to check in terms of taxes:
```
1. What is your payment `considered as?
2. Are your taxes being withheld?
```
### 1. What is your payment considered as?

The money you receive can have different `types&#39;. For example, your relocation fee is taxed at a different rate than your stipend. Also, depending on what program you are (or your status), your stipend may have varying tax rates. Also, if you&#39;re not a U.S. citizen, your country might have some sort of a tax treaty that changes your tax rate. I am not a professional so I can&#39;t tell you the specifics, but do keep these variables in consideration.

### 2. Are your taxes being withheld?

When your employer pays you, they might `withhold your tax`, meaning that they already take your taxes into account. That is what `tax returns` are, when you get money back from the IRS after `withholding` more tax than you actually need to pay (more explained below). In my internship, my tax was not withheld, and I got the pre-tax amount in my bank account. I had to pay a pretty hefty chunk sum (~700$) come tax time because I did not pay for that income (i.e. it was not withheld).

So this is a very brief explanation of how it happens - your employer pays you, at an internship or whatever, and you get a thing called a W-2 sometime late January or February (so if you interend Summer 2019, you&#39;d get your W2 on Jan/Feb 2020). That form will list how much you got paid, and how much was withheld. Then you calculate your income tax ([link](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes)). If the amount you have to pay is less than the withheld amount, you get money back (because you overpaid in taxes). If the calculated amount is higher than the withheld amount, you have to pay the IRS. You can do this whole process by using a tax software or using any free online tools. So don&#39;t be too excited for your internship paycheck. Think about taxes (I know, major buzzkill).



## Drivers license

When you move to Knoxville (for a more permanent position), you have to get a TN drivers license.
Note that you need an ID and 2 proofs of residency to get it. ([link](https://www.tn.gov/safety/driver-services/classd/dlnew.html)). 

For non citizens, do note that some places won't do `foreigners` (I know right). The place I know that does it are [here](https://www.dmvnearme.net/en/oak-ridge-driver-services-center/767) and [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Knoxville%2FStrawberry+Plains+Driver+Services+Center/@36.00152,-83.9030249,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa388d08488115946!8m2!3d36.00152!4d-83.771704). Also, some places don't do new licenses, and only do renewals. I was able to get a new license, as a foreigner from [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Knoxville%2FStrawberry+Plains+Driver+Services+Center/@36.00152,-83.9030249,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa388d08488115946!8m2!3d36.00152!4d-83.771704), and was able to get it renewed [here](https://www.dmvnearme.net/en/oak-ridge-driver-services-center/767). Guess who waited in a clusterflock for an hour to find that out. Also, pay extra care for your identity documents as a non-citizen (I know right, story of my life). You'd need your passport, and your proof that you're not illegal (I-20 for F1, I-797 for H1b). They also issue the drivers license up till your status expiration date. So that's fun.

What other stuff??
