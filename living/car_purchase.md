# Buying a car

Your best bet would be to get an auto loan from the credit union. No one else (e.g. Chase, other banks) will probably give you a loan, especially if you're in a shorter-term H1b visa. Because H1b visas are 3-year max, you will not be approved for a 5-year car loan. You may be able to get a 1-year loan, but then your monthly payments are going to be quite high. The ORNL credit union knows whats up. They know that H1b visa holders who work at ORNL tend to (or at least intend to) stay and are reliable lenders. So they will usually approve you for a longer-term car loan. I currently have a 5-year car loan with ORNL credit union.
