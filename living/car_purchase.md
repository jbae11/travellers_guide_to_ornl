## Getting the loan
If you are not a U.S. citizen, your best bet would be to get an auto loan from the credit union. No one else (e.g. Chase, other banks) will probably give you a loan. Because visas have expiration dates, you will not be approved for a car loan that is longer than your visa duration (e.g. H1b visa holders may not be able to get a car loan longer than 3 years). You may be able to get a 1-year loan, but then your monthly payments are going to be quite high. The ORNL credit union knows whats up. They know that H1b visa holders who work at ORNL tend to (or at least intend to) stay and are reliable lenders. So they will usually approve you for a longer-term car loan. I currently have a 5-year car loan with ORNL credit union.
