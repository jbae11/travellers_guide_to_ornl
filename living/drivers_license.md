# Drivers license

When you move to Knoxville (for a more permanent position), you have to get a TN drivers license.
Note that you need an ID and 2 proofs of residency to get it. ([link](https://www.tn.gov/safety/driver-services/classd/dlnew.html)). 

For non citizens, do note that some places won't do `foreigners` (I know right). The place I know that does it are [here](https://www.dmvnearme.net/en/oak-ridge-driver-services-center/767) and [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Knoxville%2FStrawberry+Plains+Driver+Services+Center/@36.00152,-83.9030249,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa388d08488115946!8m2!3d36.00152!4d-83.771704). Also, some places don't do new licenses, and only do renewals. I was able to get a new license, as a foreigner from [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Knoxville%2FStrawberry+Plains+Driver+Services+Center/@36.00152,-83.9030249,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xa388d08488115946!8m2!3d36.00152!4d-83.771704), and was able to get it renewed [here](https://www.dmvnearme.net/en/oak-ridge-driver-services-center/767). Guess who waited in a clusterflock for an hour to find that out. Also, pay extra care for your identity documents as a non-citizen (I know right, story of my life). You'd need your passport, and your proof that you're not illegal (I-20 for F1, I-797 for H1b). They also issue the drivers license up till your status expiration date. So that's fun.
