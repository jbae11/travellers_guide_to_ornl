You know what they say, housing is always location location location. Here&#39;s the map of the neighborhoods around Knoxville. This map will hopefully get you a better idea of the landscape.

![](https://github.com/jbae11/travellers_guide_to_ornl/blob/master/images/map.png)

The red numbers are points of interest, or different neighborhoods in Knoxville with things to do, or places where you can live. Sites with a `walk-friendly&#39; note means that you can take an uber there, and walk around. If that note is not there, it means that you cannot go from shop-to-shop on foot.

## 1. Knoxville Downtown (walk-friendly)

Knoxville downtown has a lot of cool restaurants and bars. Parking is abundant and free during weekends and weekdays after 6pm. It has a pretty good brunch and dinner scene. Cuisines offered are mostly American. Most of the restaurants and bars are on Gay street and Market Square. There are also theatres along Gay Street. South Knoxville (across the river from `downtown downtown&#39;) is an up-and-coming sort of hipster neighborhood, with microbreweries and hipster coffee shops.

## 2. University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK) campus  (walk-friendly)

UTK is a pretty small campustown, with small bars and restaurants. The campus is quite nice and has a pretty big sports scene, the football stadium is pretty big. The Cumberland avenue, which is the main street of the campus, has a lot of mostly fast food restaurants, as well as a walgreens.

## 3. Bearden / West Town Mall  (no-walk)

Bearden is a neighborhood with the west town mall (it&#39;s a mid-sized mall), with restaurants and shops. There are used bookstores and thai, vietanmese, and korean restaurants (they&#39;re okay).

## 4. Turkey Creek / Farragut (no-walk)

Turkey creek is another one of those pockets of shops and restaurants. It has a Costco, Walmart, Target, etc. Farragut is low-key considered as a more mid-upper part of Knoxville, like a wealthier suburb. It also has nicer restaurants and cafes. South of Farragut is Concord park (barely shown in map), where there is a body of water and nice picnic tables, as well as a small golf course and tennis courts. If you&#39;re buying a house, a lot of the employees live in houses here, because the schools are pretty good.

## 5. Hardin Valley (no-walk)

Hardin Valley is a small neighborhood that stretches long across Hardin Valley road. There is a community college (Pellissippi), and near it are some restaurants and apartments. I live here. It has a Food City (grocery store) nearby, but inaccessible by foot. Also, if you are working on advanced manufacturing, the ORNL hardin valley campus (MDF) is here.

## 6. Oak Ridge (no-walk)

Oak Ridge city has most of the things you&#39;d expect from a small town - Panda Express, Aldi, Walmart, Starbucks, the usual. Pretty standard, but not a lot of decent housing (I heard).


## Bus route

The purple `s&#39; labels are of the bus route. Details of the bus routes can be seen in the [link](https://ridethet.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2019/07/ORNL-PSCC-Route-Info-2019-20.pdf). Note that the bus schedule follows the school calendar, so it will not run during school breaks. Also, it only runs three times a day. S1 is the Univ of Tennessee campus, S2 is the Pellissippi State Community college, and the last stop is the visitor&#39;s center at ORNL.

The brown letters are the east and west gate at ORNL. They are the only entry point to ORNL. The visitor&#39;s center is ~10 mins from the east gate, and ~5 mins from the west gate.

Now that you have a general idea of the landscape, below are the housing recommendations (completely in my personal opinion, not ranked in any way). Note that given your stay duration, and time of year, a lot things would change. Full disclosure - I live at the Enclave of Hardin Valley. I chose this place because it is the closest to the bus stop, and I can walk to the gym. (The apartments are uphill from a strip-mall like plaza that has a pizza place, a hibachi place, a gym, and a church-like thing)

Also note that a lot of apartments are unfurnished, which makes it doubly attractive to get a sublease, since you wouldn&#39;t have to buy/bring all the furniture. There are rental services available, but they&#39;re probably more expensive than buying used furniture. Also, washer and dryer on-site is quite unique (just another thing to look for).  Another thing to note is that it might be difficult to sign a lease without a social security number ( one way around it is to get a co-signer, someone to vouch for you).



## 1. Knoxville Downtown
  1. (+) There are some cool apartments here. Some apartments are open-floor, studio apartments, and it&#39;s pretty urban.
  2. (+) You can walk to different cafes, bars, and brunch places.
  3. (-) Quite expensive (expect to pay 800+ / month)
  4. (-) Commute can be long (~35 minutes one way no traffic. \&gt;45 minutes with traffic)
  5. (-) Your lease terms may be difficult if you&#39;re staying for only a short amount of time
## 2. UTK campus
  1. (+) May be able to score good deals over the summer by subleasing students&#39; apartments
  2. (+) Walkable to the bus stop, restaurants, bars, and semi-close to grocery stores
  3. (-) Kind of loud at night (might not be during the summer)
  4. (-) Your commute is going to be long (~30 minutes one way no traffic, \&gt;40 minutes with traffic)
  5. If you&#39;re subleasing, make sure you have your understanding right, so you don&#39;t get kicked out in the middle of your internship. Also, make sure who your roommates are. (lot of drama over roommates)
## 3. Hardin Valley
  1. (+) I might be biased, but personally the most ideal place for ORNL employees.
  2. (+) Reasonable rent with many apartment choices, and relatively close to everything (20 mins to ORNL, 10 mins to Turkey Creek, 20 mins to downtown)
  3. (+) Most apartments have a pool and gym.
  4. (+) Semi-walkable to the bus stop and restaurants.
  5. (-) If you don&#39;t have a car, you might feel trapped.
  6. (-) Lease may be difficult for summer interns.
## 4. Oak Ridge
  1. (+) Pretty close to ORNL (20 mins)
  2. (+) Rent may be cheaper, and more sublease (Airbnb) opportunities.
  3. (-) Difficult without car
  4. (-) Far from mostly anything else
