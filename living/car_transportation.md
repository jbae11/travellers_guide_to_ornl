# Car / transportation

If you have a car, or plan to buy one, you&#39;re probably set (There's more about buying a car later). But the truth is that a lot of interns or foreigners dont have cars. But do note that living in Knoxville without a car is quite difficult. Unless you live on campus or downtown, you can&#39;t really walk / bike to restaurants / grocery stores. More is explained below. Also, if you haven&#39;t heard, the ORNL campus (the main campus. The MDF campus is not.) is a guarded campus with two entrance gates (also shown on map below). Here are your options for your commute to work:

## 1. Carpool

The best idea would be to live with someone who has a car, so you can ride with them. If that is not the case, you can find people that can give you rides at the Facebook group, or other means. Make sure you&#39;re courteous by offering to pay for gas and being punctual.

## 2. Bus

There is a bus route to ORNL, that runs three times a day, during school times (and summer). More information is shown below. Other than that, public transportation is not really available.

## 3. Uber / Lyft

It is possible to take an Uber to the lab. Recently, Uber cars are allowed to enter the lab. It is costly to do it everyday ($35 to $50 round trip, depending on where you live, and when you call them).

## 4. Rental car

You can rent a car from the airport or anywhere in town. The daily rate can range from $20 to $50. ORAU has an agreement with Enterprise and National that might make it cheaper ([more info](https://www.orau.org/travel/reservations/rental-vehicle.htm)). But make sure you can use that agreement for your case.

## Traffic

The I-40 (map below, yellow going horizontally) is the main highway for most things. It is usually not that packed, except for rush hour (7:30 - 9:00 AM, 4:30 - 6:00 PM), then your travel time is multiplied by approximately 1.7.

More or less your drive would include some form of taking the I-40. More is explained below.

## Airport:

The airport for Knoxville is TYS, which is 30 minutes south of downtown Knoxville. You can catch an uber from the airport (or rent a car), but sometimes when it&#39;s late, it is hard to catch an uber. The rental car offices are 24/7.
