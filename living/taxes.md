# Taxes

I am by no means a tax expert, so do your own research. I know that for some of you, this would be your first time having to think about U.S. taxes. This is based completely on what I&#39;ve gone through and what I&#39;ve seen from other people.

There are two things to check in terms of taxes:
```
1. What is your payment `considered as?
2. Are your taxes being withheld?
```
## 1. What is your payment considered as?

The money you receive can have different `types&#39;. For example, your relocation fee is taxed at a different rate than your stipend. Also, depending on what program you are (or your status), your stipend may have varying tax rates. Also, if you&#39;re not a U.S. citizen, your country might have some sort of a tax treaty that changes your tax rate. I am not a professional so I can&#39;t tell you the specifics, but do keep these variables in consideration.

## 2. Are your taxes being withheld?

When your employer pays you, they might `withhold your tax`, meaning that they already take your taxes into account. That is what `tax returns` are, when you get money back from the IRS after `withholding` more tax than you actually need to pay (more explained below). In my internship, my tax was not withheld, and I got the pre-tax amount in my bank account. I had to pay a pretty hefty chunk sum (~700$) come tax time because I did not pay for that income (i.e. it was not withheld).

So this is a very brief explanation of how it happens - your employer pays you, at an internship or whatever, and you get a thing called a W-2 sometime late January or February (so if you interend Summer 2019, you&#39;d get your W2 on Jan/Feb 2020). That form will list how much you got paid, and how much was withheld. Then you calculate your income tax ([link](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes)). If the amount you have to pay is less than the withheld amount, you get money back (because you overpaid in taxes). If the calculated amount is higher than the withheld amount, you have to pay the IRS. You can do this whole process by using a tax software or using any free online tools. So don&#39;t be too excited for your internship paycheck. Think about taxes (I know, major buzzkill).
