# Calendar / Fiscal Year

It is important to not the difference between fiscal and calendar year.
Calendar year is the normal year, to which everybody lives on.
Fiscal year is a `one-year period that companies and governments
use for financial reporting and budgeting`. For us, since we follow
the government calendar, a new fiscal year (FY) starts in 
October 1st. In other word, a new FY begins in the October 1st, of the previous year.
Here's a table of examples:

| Calendar Year | Fiscal Year |
|---------------|-------------|
| 08/02/2019    | FY 2019     |
| 10/02/2019    | FY 2020     |
| 01/01/2020    | FY 2020     |
| 09/01/2020    | FY 2020     |
| 10/02/2020    | FY 2021     |

The FY usually is the timeline for projects and proposals. Everything
is more or less measured in those terms. So a lot of evaluations and
deliverables are due on the end of the FY (such as [EPMs]((https://github.com/jbae11/travellers_guide_to_ornl/blob/master/ornl_logistics/epms.md))). Also, quarters are a block of three months.
Sometimes reports are due every quarter as well. But as most things listed in this 
guide, it all depends on your institution, group, supervisor, etc.
