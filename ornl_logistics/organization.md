# Organization

You will hear a lot of different organization lingo, and it might confuse you. So here's a rundown. The
below list is from larger to smaller organizations:


1. UT-Battelle, LLC (company):

This confuses new people, but UT-Battelle is the DOE contractor that manages
ORNL. So ORNL is a place name, but your official employer (and mostly anything logistical)
is UT-Battelle. You are an employee of UT-Battelle, not ORNL.

2. Directorate
3. Division
4. Group
5. Team
6. SubTeam
