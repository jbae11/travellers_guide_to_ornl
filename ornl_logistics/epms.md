# Employee Performance Management (EPM)

Every FY, employees undergo something called an Employee
Performance Management (EPM). You can access your EPM
via the ORNL portal alphabet thing. The format and the content
can differ between groups and divisions, but generally the
idea is to:

1. List your performance plan (things you're going to do this FY)
2. List your accomplishments (things you've done in this FY)

So for me step 1 was done way before the end of FY (and you
can update this whenever you want), and I recommend
you keep it as updated as possible. Again, the format and
content may differ, but here's a very generic example:

## Title:
Project for machine learning model

## Objectives / Measures:
1. Generate data
    - use [software] to generate data
    - parse / curate data into database
2. Train / test model
    - use [algorithms] to train model
    - test / visualize performance
3. Implement model into [software]
    - Implement trained model in [software]
    - Test studies & validation


## Track Progress of Plan:
1. Generate data
    - generated 100,000 labeled datasets
    - uploaded database to [cluster] for future usage
2. Train /test model
    - [performance metric]
3. Implement model into [software]
    - validation study results summary


This EPM then goes through a series of review. The
`Key Performance Indicator` is a metric for your
performance, such as publications, presentations,
etc. Depending on your position you might have a
required number for your indicator.
